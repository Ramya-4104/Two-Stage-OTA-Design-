# Two-Stage-OTA-Design

Project Overview:

This project involves the design and simulation of a Two-Stage Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) using LTSpice, with the goal of meeting key performance requirements for analog integrated circuit applications. The OTA was built using a differential input stage followed by a gain stage, enabling high open-loop gain and better output swing. The design also includes Miller compensation to ensure frequency stability and an adequate phase margin.

The amplifier was optimized for metrics such as gain, slew rate, gain-bandwidth product (GBW), output swing, and phase margin. Transient, DC, and AC analyses were conducted in LTSpice to evaluate and fine-tune these parameters. Through careful biasing and transistor sizing, the design achieved a good trade-off between speed, stability, and power consumption.

All simulations and plots were generated using LTSpice to validate the performance across different test conditions. The final OTA is suitable for applications in analog filters, ADC input stages, or general-purpose analog processing systems where linearity and stability are crucial.
